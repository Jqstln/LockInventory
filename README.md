<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I've started to make this **plugin** for my own minecraft network, to lock the inventory in your hotbar,
more specfied on moving it aswell in your inventory.

Currently I'm trying ofcourse my best to keep this updated and other things.


### Built With

* [SpigotMC API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/)
* [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can of course just download the project, but I cannot guarantee that the plugin will work GOOD. This is only the first version.
